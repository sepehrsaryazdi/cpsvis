# Convex Projective Surface Visualisation Tool

This GitHub project is dedicated to producing accurate and robust implementations of numerous algorithms in the study convex projective surfaces and the length spectra on them. These algorithms are founded in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04176) (Haraway, LÃ¶we, Tate, Tillmann 2019).

## Installation

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-tk
python3 -m pip install cpsvis
```
## Mac (tkinter should already be distributed)

```
pip3 install tk
pip3 install cpsvis
```

## Windows (tkinter should already be distributed)

```
pip3 install cpsvis
